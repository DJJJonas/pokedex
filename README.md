## About

This project was initially made for fun as a minimalist front-end
for the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). As of I'm writing this,
features are constantly being added just as a way of warming my skills up because this is what I love the most: code.

## Features

The list of implemented features are:

- Search auto-complete
- Sidebar
  - Delete non-favorite history
  - History
    - Favorite searches
    - Organize order

More features are being added over time.
